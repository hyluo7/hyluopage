Hi, this is Haoyu Luo
======
I'm Haoyu Luo, a third year undergraduate student from [School of IC](https://ic.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University, China](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Nanomaterial, Bioelectric material, Nanostructure fabrication and characterization and MEMS for interdisciplinary intersections with embedded system and integrate circuit.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hong](https://ic.seu.edu.cn/honghua/main.psp) from [School of IC](https://ic.seu.edu.cn/) of [SEU-FEI Nano-Pico Center](http://www.seu-npc.com/), Key Lab of MEMS of Ministry of Education for [School of IC](https://ic.seu.edu.cn/), Southeasy University, China. I was also advised by [Prof. Yi](https://ic.seu.edu.cn/yizhenxiang/main.psp) from [School of IC](https://ic.seu.edu.cn/), Southeast University, China.

You can find my Resume here: [Resume of Haoyu Luo](../assets/resumenew.pdf).

My journey of exploring to academic
======
One area of research that particularly intrigues me is bioelectronics. For instance, the current research project I am involved in, titled "Alignment of carbon nanotubes in biocompatible polymer under electric-field," originates from the treatment and rehabilitation of spinal cord injuries. I am deeply motivated to leverage my expertise in electronics to contribute to advancements in human and biological welfare. Also, the project "Preparation and Properties of Grapheneâ€“Reinforced Polylactic Acid Bioelectronic Nanocomposites with Tissue Regenerative Functions" offered me precious experience.
Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired a strong foundation in Electronic Science and Technology, including courses such as analog electronic circuits, digital electronic circuits, signals and systems, basic solid-state physics, basic semiconductor physics, as well as mathematical courses such as mathematical physics methods, probability statistics, and random processes. Additionally, I have undertaken specialized courses like modern optics fundamentals, microcomputer principles, and electromagnetic field theory.
